#Plant-seedling-classification
Domain Background
Image classification has become one of the most important problems that Machine learning and deep learning can solve.

In This project I will use one of kaggle Competition’s dataset, this dataset contains images of approximately 960 unique plants belonging to 12 species at several growth stages It comprises annotated RGB images with a physical resolution of roughly 10 pixels per mm. The SIGNAL PROCESSING GROUP Department of Engineering – Aarhus University had uploaded this dataset in order to give it wider exposure, to give the community an opportunity to experiment with different image recognition techniques, as well to provide a place to cross-pollinate ideas.

The database have been recorded at Aarhus University Flakkebjerg Research station in a collaboration between University of Southern Denmark and Aarhus University. You can find the dataset here , the dataset has 1.7 G as training set (Nonsegmented single plants) The problem here is the weed seedling is much like crop seedling and our goal is to be able to differentiate between them using Machine learning and deep learning techniques.
